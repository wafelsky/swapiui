#Welcome!

This project was built using swapi.dev api and swapi.py4e.com mirror.

Assuming you have node installed, you also need to install react with

npx install create-react-app {NAME OF OF YOUR CHOICE}

and sass with 

yarn add node-sass@4.14.1

Older version of sass because of some bugs. Nevertheless, 

#enjoy!
