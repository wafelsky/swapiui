Instalation

This project was built using swapi.dev api and swapi.py4e.com mirror. Assuming you have node installed, you also need to install react with:

npx install create-react-app {NAME OF OF YOUR CHOICE}
and
yarn add node-sass@4.14.1

You can also view a prototype on : https://swapiui.netlify.app/ however the url endpoints are not working on netlify and I have no acces to htacces.

Hopefully one day I will come back and fix this mess of a prop drilling hell.
